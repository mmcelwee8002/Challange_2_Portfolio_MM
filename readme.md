# Challange-2- Personal Portfolio-Matthew McElwee

## Purpose
A website is challange #2 for bootcamp so it is an assignment
It is the start of a personal portfolio that I will use to showcase my development skills.

As of now I only have one project to show and that is the first and largest box called "Run Buddy"
The others are sample websites that are used as placeholders.
